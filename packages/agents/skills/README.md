# skills scaffold

This folder is a scaffold for MoltBot skills that will be distributed via:

`npx @wiimdy/openfunderse@latest install openfunderse`

Planned bundles:
- `strategy`
- `participant`
- `relayer`

Each bundle should include:
- `SKILL.md` with runtime instructions and tool contracts
- referenced prompt files in `../prompts/*`
- test fixtures for installation validation
