# Diagrams (Excalidraw)

This folder contains importable Excalidraw diagrams for the ChatOps swarm fund architecture.

## Files
- `chatops_workflow.excalidraw`: System workflow diagram (EN).
- `chatops_workflow_kr.excalidraw`: System workflow diagram (KR).
- `chatops_workflow.mmd`: Mermaid source (EN).

## Import Into Excalidraw (e.g., a shared room)
1. Open your Excalidraw board/room.
2. Import:
   - Drag and drop the `.excalidraw` file into the canvas, or
   - Menu (top-left) -> `Open` -> `Import` -> select the file.

Note: importing a scene may replace the current canvas contents. If you already have drawings in the room, duplicate the board or copy/paste them elsewhere first.
