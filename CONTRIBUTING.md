# Contributing

## Workflow
- Use GitHub Issues as the source of truth for tasks.
- Prefer small PRs that are easy to review.
- Link PRs to Issues using `Fixes #<id>` or `Refs #<id>`.

## Issue Quality Bar
Every task issue should have:
- Goal
- Acceptance Criteria
- Owner
- Links/References (if relevant)

## Decision Records (ADR)
For protocol/architecture changes, add an ADR under `docs/decisions/`.

## Branches
- Use short, descriptive branch names.
- Example: `feat/claimbook-eip712` or `fix/intenthash-ordering`
